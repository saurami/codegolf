# Valid Anagram

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging letters of a different word or phrase (typically) once.

Given two strings `x` and `y`, return `true` if `y` is an anagram of `x`, and `false` otherwise.

**Exercise 1:**

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

+ `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`

+ `x` and `y` consist of lowercase English letters.
